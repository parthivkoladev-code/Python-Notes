## Ways to create a python program and execute it

### Interactive Terminal


- We type python in the terminal and then code then it executes right away and to exit we use "exit()"
- It's basically python directly in terminal.

```bash
parthivkola@fedora:~$ python
Python 3.14.0 (main, Oct  7 2025, 00:00:00) [GCC 15.2.1 20250924 (Red Hat 15.2.1-2)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
>>> exit()
```

### Using python3

- code in file named "1_test.py"

```python 
print("Hello World")
```

- we can execute in terminal

```bash
parthivkola@fedora:~/python_roadmap/basic_syntax$ python3 1_test.py 
Hello World
```

### Making the file executable

- add the following line to the code and make it

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print("Hello World")
```

- now we can run the program with

```bash
parthivkola@fedora:~/python_roadmap/basic_syntax$ chmod +x 1_test.py
parthivkola@fedora:~/python_roadmap/basic_syntax$ ./1_test.py 
Hello World
```


## Python Identifiers

A Python identifier is a name used to identify a [variable](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variables.htm), [function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm), [class](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_object_classes.htm), [module](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm) or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).

Python does not allow punctuation characters such as &commat;, $, and % within identifiers.

>Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, **Manpower** and **manpower** are two different identifiers in Python.

- Python Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is **private** identifier.
- Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly **private** identifier.
- If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a **language-defined** special name.


## Python Reserved Words

The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constant or variable or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.

| and     | as       | assert   |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| break   | class    | continue |
| def     | del      | elif     |
| else    | except   | False    |
| finally | for      | from     |
| global  | if       | import   |
| in      | is       | lambda   |
| None    | nonlocal | not      |
| or      | pass     | raise    |
| return  | True     | try      |
| while   | with     | yield    |


## Python Lines and Indentation

Python programming provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by **line indentation**, which is rigidly enforced.

The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount.


## Python Multi-Line Statements

Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. For example −

```python
total = item_one + \ 
item_two + \ 
item_three
```

Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example following statement works well in Python −

```python
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
		'Thursday', 'Friday']
```



## Quotations in Python

Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal −

```python
word = 'word' 
print (word) 

sentence = "This is a sentence." 
print (sentence) 

paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is 
made up of multiple lines and sentences.""" 
print (paragraph)
```



## Comments in Python

A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the Python source code. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are ignored by Python interpreter

Just like most modern languages, Python supports single-line (or end-of-line) and multi-line (block) comments. [Python comments](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_comments.htm) are very much similar to the comments available in PHP, BASH and Perl Programming languages.

A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.

```python
# First comment 
print ("Hello, World!") # Second comment
```

This produces the following result −

```bash
Hello, World!
```

Following triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be used as a multi-line comments:

```python
''' This is a multiline 
comment. '''
```




## Waiting for the User

The following line of the program displays the prompt, the statement saying Press the enter key to exit, and waits for the user to take action −

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

raw_input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```

Here, "\n\n" is used to create two new lines before displaying the actual line. Once the user presses the key, the program ends. This is a nice trick to keep a console window open until the user is done with an application.



## Multiple Statements on a Single Line

The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block. Here is a sample snip using the semicolon −

```PYTHON
import sys; x = 'foo'; sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
```




## Command Line Arguments in Python

Many programs can be run to provide you with some basic information about how they should be run. Python enables you to do this with -h −

```bash
parthivkola@fedora:~/python_roadmap/basic_syntax$ python3 -h
usage: python3 [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options (and corresponding environment variables):
-b     : issue warnings about converting bytes/bytearray to str and comparing
         bytes/bytearray with str or bytes with int. (-bb: issue errors)
-B     : don't write .pyc files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : turn on parser debugging output (for experts only, only works on
         debug builds); also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also -? or --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-I     : isolate Python from the user's environment (implies -E, -P and -s)
-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
-O     : remove assert and __debug__-dependent statements; add .opt-1 before
         .pyc extension; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x
-OO    : do -O changes and also discard docstrings; add .opt-2 before
         .pyc extension
-P     : don't prepend a potentially unsafe path to sys.path; also
         PYTHONSAFEPATH
-q     : don't print version and copyright messages on interactive startup
-s     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE=x
-S     : don't imply 'import site' on initialization
-u     : force the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered;
         this option has no effect on stdin; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
-v     : verbose (trace import statements); also PYTHONVERBOSE=x
         can be supplied multiple times to increase verbosity
-V     : print the Python version number and exit (also --version)
         when given twice, print more information about the build
-W arg : warning control; arg is action:message:category:module:lineno
         also PYTHONWARNINGS=arg
-x     : skip first line of source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of #!cmd
-X opt : set implementation-specific option
--check-hash-based-pycs always|default|never:
         control how Python invalidates hash-based .pyc files
--help-env: print help about Python environment variables and exit
--help-xoptions: print help about implementation-specific -X options and exit
--help-all: print complete help information and exit

Arguments:
file   : program read from script file
-      : program read from stdin (default; interactive mode if a tty)
arg ...: arguments passed to program in sys.argv[1:]
```

You can also program your script in such a way that it should accept various options. [Command Line Arguments](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm) is an advanced topic and should be studied a bit later once you have gone through rest of the Python concepts.
